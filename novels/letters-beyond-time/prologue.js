  "Life’s unpredictability really shows at times you don’t expect, doesn’t it? For a second, you may be having the time of your life… yet one small thing can propel you towards a totally different direction, shifting the tides of your life.",
  "These past few days… I’ve scoured throughout the vast pages of the internet, all for an answer to a mystery that latched onto me.",
  "Have you ever received a random letter?",
  "Not just any letter… but one sent from the future, ridiculous isn’t it?",
  "The essence of time itself has been progressive and never came to a halt under any circumstance. It’s what gives meaning to the joy of living day by day, but it’s also what limits us. Though it may prove that we are indeed progressing, it proceeds onwards as we humans continue to march on til our eventual demise.",
  "Time has never accompanied us in our life, it’s a merciless tool that determines how far we have come.",
  "Once I drop dead at any moment, time will go on… leaving me behind as the timeline continues to stretch forward.",
  "While many desire for the rewindal of time, it’s linear and never deviates from its rules. There are no roundabouts or tricks that one may learn to adjust time, we’re in it, and we’re left with no choice but to follow through or be left behind.",
  "If that’s truly the case…",
  "…how come these letters end up in my path?"
