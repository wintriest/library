  "The following day, all I could focus on was observing my classmates for the first time. I’m fully aware that most of the girls dislike me. The only students I’m familiar with are Hayashi-kun, my seatmate. Sakuragi from yesterday, and the president of the room named Kujou-san, that’s all I know.",
  "It has already been months since the entrance ceremony. My introduction back in day one was simply “My name’s Aihara, I’ll be your classmate.” The boys seemed to be cheering for me when I stood up, their gazes eagerly set upon me, but the moment I introduced myself in such a manner, it felt like I killed their expectations.",
  "As I walked toward my seat, the guy from yesterday was waving.",
  "Well <i>worry not</i>, I’m a loner and I see no problem with not fulfilling their expectations. As a human being, I’ve lived a regular life. Some people can say their things about me here and there but <i>I pay no mind.</i>",
  "As I pondered on my thoughts, Hayashi-kun finally arrived in class.",
  "“Hm? Hey.” he said, catching me off guard.",
  "Involuntarily, I’d been staring at him ever since he stepped foot within the classroom. “...hello.” I said and looked outside the window <i>not wanting to continue the conversation.</i>",
  "As I hoped, he understood that there was nothing behind that stare. It’s early in the morning and I was merely dozing off, but I did notice Sakuragi giving me a weird look.",
  "Looking at Hayashi-kun clearly, he’s got the looks. It’s hard to tell with the uniform’s blazer, but he seems well built—like he might be an athlete or something. They say he’s boring, but he’s honestly not, he’s unique. He has great manners and a keen eye.",
  "“You’re staring at me again.” he said, <i>there’s his keen eye.</i>",
  "“I was dozing off.”",
  "“I see.”",
  "The conversation immediately died, it’s kind of comfortable… this kind of interaction, <i>it isn’t heavy.</i>",
  "Perhaps in a world where everyone is like Hayashi-kun, <i>I can thrive and talk to everyone with ease.</i>",
  "The different groups of popular students in the classroom suddenly arrived and I was forced to revert back to being silent as I didn’t want to catch any of their attention.",
  "Now it was I that noticed him glancing at me. Before I could ask, he simply shook his head and minded his own business.",
  "<i>This person truly is unusual.</i>"
